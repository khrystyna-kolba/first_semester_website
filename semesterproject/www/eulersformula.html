				<h2>The Most Beautiful Equation</h2>
				<img src="imgs/eulersidentity.jpg" alt="euler's formula graph" style="height: 300px;">
				<p>Euler’s identity is an equality found in mathematics that has been compared to
				a Shakespearean sonnet and described as "the most beautiful equation." It is a special
				case of a foundational equation in complex arithmetic called Euler’s Formula, which the
				late great physicist Richard Feynman called in his lectures "our jewel" and "the most
				remarkable formula in mathematics." 
				In an interview with the BBC, Prof David Percy of the Institute of Mathematics and
				its Applications said Euler's Identity was “a real classic and you can do no better
				than that … It is simple to look at and yet incredibly profound, it comprises the
				five most important mathematical constants.”<br>
				Euler's Identity is written simply as: e<sup>iπ</sup> + 1 = 0</p> 
				<p>The five constants are:<br>

						 called because, in reality, no number can be multiplied
						 by itself to produce a negative number (and, therefore,
						 negative numbers have no real square roots). But in math,
						 there are many situations where one is forced to take the
						 square root of a negative. The letter i is therefore used
						 as a sort of stand-in to mark places where this was done.
