				<h2>What Are Imaginary Numbers?</h2>
				<img src="imgs/inum.png" alt="e constant" style="height: 300px;">
				<p>An imaginary number is a number that, when squared, has a negative result.
				Essentially, an imaginary number is the square root of a negative number and
				does not have a tangible value. While it is not a real number — that is, it
				cannot be quantified on the number line — imaginary numbers are "real" in
				the sense that they exist and are used in math.<br>
				Imaginary numbers, also called complex numbers, are used in real-life
				applications, such as electricity, as well as quadratic equations.
				In quadratic planes, imaginary numbers show up in equations that don’t
				touch the x axis. Imaginary numbers become particularly useful in advanced
				calculus.<br>
				Usually denoted by the symbol i, imaginary numbers are denoted by the
				symbol j in electronics (because i already denotes "current"). Imaginary
				numbers are particularly applicable in electricity, specifically alternating
				current (AC) electronics. AC electricity changes between positive and negative
				in a sine wave. Combining AC currents can be very difficult because they may not
				match properly on the waves. Using imaginary currents and real numbers helps those
				working with AC electricity do the calculations and avoid electrocution.<br>
				Imaginary numbers can also be applied to signal processing, which is useful
				in cellular technology and wireless technologies, as well as radar and even
				biology (brain waves). Essentially, if what is being measured relies on a sine
				or cosine wave, the imaginary number is used.</p>
