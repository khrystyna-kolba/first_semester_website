				<h2>Reasons to love Math</h2>

				<h4>1. Numbers help us understand the world, and Math helps us understand numbers.</h4> 
				<p>The real-life applications of Mathematics are endless. We are surrounded by numbers,
				equations and algorithms – especially in this age of data science, with huge data sets
				that can only be understood through statistical models and analysis. Maths gives us the
				ability to view the world in a way nothing else can!</p> 
				<h4>2. Maths is black and white, there’s no room for ambiguity.</h4>
				<p>Unlike many other subject areas, Maths is not subjective. Every question has a clear
				answer and when you solve it, you can either be right or wrong. There’s no grey area. I
				personally enjoy this objective approach and the certainty that comes with it.</p>
				<h4>3. Old concepts are as relevant as new concepts.</h4>
				<p>There is a sort of hierarchy with Mathematical concepts; for instance you simply
				cannot understand calculus without having a hold over basic algebra first. Due to this,
				you have to bear in mind that whenever you learn a new concept, it is something which
				will be referred to repeatedly as you learn the next one. As you can see how everything
				clicks into place, it makes learning more interesting and engaging.</p>
				<h4>4. Nothing can be proved without evidence.</h4>
				<p>There is no place for speculation. Whenever you try to prove something in maths, you
				need evidence. I personally believe that this is something which should be applied in
				other aspects of life as well…imagine the number of misunderstandings which could be
				prevented if visual/auditory evidence had to be provided!</p>
				<h4>5. It presents a good mind-bending challenge.</h4>
				<p>Every maths problem is a new, fresh and unique challenge. The adrenaline rush you get
				when you finally solve a problem which initially seemed impossible is unparalleled. I
				feel like maths constantly keeps you on your toes and never gets monotonous, so each new
				day learning in this wonderful subject area is unexpected and something you can look forward to.</p><br><hr>
